# Validateur, a Clojure(Script) Validation Library

Validateur is a [Clojure(Script) validation library](http://clojurevalidations.info) inspired by Ruby's ActiveModel. Validateur is functional: validators are
functions, validation sets are higher-order functions, validation results are returned as values.


## Supported Clojure versions

Validateur is tested on Clojure 1.10 or later, ClojureScript 1.11 or later.



## Maven Artifacts

Validateur artifacts are [released to Clojars](https://clojars.org/com.novemberain/validateur).
If you are using Maven, add the following repository definition to your `pom.xml`:

``` xml

## Documentation & Examples

Please refer to the [documentation guides](http://clojurevalidations.info) for Validateur.

Our test suite has usage examples for each validator, built-in validation functions have docstrings.

## Development

Validateur uses [Leiningen 2](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/TUTORIAL.md). Make
sure you have it installed and then run tests against all supported Clojure versions and a recent release of ClojureScript using

    lein all do clean, test

Then create a branch and make your changes on it. Once you are done with your changes and all
tests pass, submit a pull request on Github.
